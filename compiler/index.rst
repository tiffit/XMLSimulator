Compiler Introduction
=====================

The XML compiler is a tool that allows you to create XML that is much easier to read and write and turn it into something that can be used in RotMG.
The term ``compilable xml`` will be used to refer to xml files that can be compiled by the compiler to be used in RotMG. Compilable files are
placed in the ``cxml`` directory. When compiled, the compiled file will be placed in the ``xml`` directory and have the same name. Any existing XML file
in the ``xml`` folder with the same name will be overriden. 

A compilable XML file can be the exact same as a normal XML file and will work. If the compilable XML file already works in RotMG, it will be as if the file
was simply copied over to the ``xml`` directory.
